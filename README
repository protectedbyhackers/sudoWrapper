This is a wrapper to use on linux machines that have python installed.
It is be developed for use against ubuntu12.04 and later as this operation system is becoming very popular.

Right now the mailutils is needed for the system as it does not come preinstalled on the system, however I am experimenting with a copied binary to the main directory.

This project is strictly for educational purposes. This is being created for use by a penetration testing company when physical access to a computer is granted. 

If you have any problems or suggestions please email logixmorg@gmail.com with sudoWrapper in the subject line.
